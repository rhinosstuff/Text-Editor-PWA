  ## Description
  This is my 19th challenge. In this challenge I was given starter code and was addressed with the task of implementing these features:
  * Uses IndexedDB to create an object store and includes both GET and PUT methods 
  * The application works without an internet connection Automatically saves content inside the text editor when the DOM window is unfocused. 
  * Bundled with webpack Create a service worker with workbox that Caches static assets.
  * The application should use babel in order to use async / await Application must have a generated manifest.json using the WebpackPwaManifest plug-in 
  * Can be installed as a Progressive Web Application
